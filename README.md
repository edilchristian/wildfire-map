I have always been intrigued by Geography and all my friends know about my love for Maps. So when I found the maps library in React, and the Google Maps API, I wanted to do something creative with it. One of my friends is studying in the West Coast and she was describing a wildfire incident that happened near her city. This inspired me to create a React App which displays the wildfire incidents across America and other countries too. I fetched the wildfire data from NASA EONET API and used Iconify library to visualize the fires using emotiocons. And then used Vercel to deploy the web-app. Also, thanks to Brad Traversy for ideas and design for this webapp.

P.S: A pop up box appears when loading the webapp, saying "This page can't load Google Maps correctly" because Google Maps is no longer free and hence the thumbnails appear all across the map. Just press "OK". 

Technologies used:
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- NASA EONET API
- Google Maps API
- Iconify

How to Use:
Open wildfire-map-react.vercel.app and press "OK" for the pop up box. Then click on any red fire icon and a box with the information regarding that wildfire will be seen.
